# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING RESOURCES
## (ONGOING)

Welcome. Feel free to explore around. I've collected tons of wonderful information that will help you in your tech career journey. Keep in mind though, this guide is backend centric instead of front-end. but the general main topics are still useful for anyone.

Before we begin. I'd like to talk about how your learning journey will be completely different depending on goal, timeline, and resources.

This is a great 10-books guide on teaching yourself Computer Science, this curriculum is designed for busy people who doesn't have time to learn computer science from many resources, classes, and courses.

But for others who has spare time to study more, I have curated a list of resources for you.

**General Main Topics**:
- Fundamental Computer Science (understanding how computers work, algorithms and data structures, underlying computer systems. (hardware centric))
- System Administration (understanding how computer systems work by knowing how to administer one. (software centric))
- Programming (knowing how to write computer programs. as in, simple programs with simple functions)
- Software Development (knowing how to develop software programs. mid-scale programs that has many functionalities)

**Specialized Main Topics**: (non-exhaustive list)
- Cloud Computing
- Artificial Intelligence and ML
- DevOps
- Security
- Software Design and Architecture
- Site-Reliability Engineering
